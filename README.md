# Exploratory Data Analysis of OCD Healthcare Dataset

## Introduction:
This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) healthcare. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains information about patients with OCD, including demographic details, clinical profiles, treatment information, and symptom severity scores. The analysis will be conducted using MySQL Workbench for data exploration and manipulation, followed by visualization using Power BI.

## Dataset Description:
Check out the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data/).
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

- Patient ID
- Age
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Marital Status
- Education Level
- OCD Diagnosis Date
- Duration of Symptoms (months)
- Previous Diagnoses
- Family History of OCD
- Obsession Type
- Compulsion Type
- Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions)
- Y-BOCS Score (Compulsions)
- Depression Diagnosis
- Anxiety Diagnosis
- Medications

## Project Objectives:

Explore the demographic distribution of patients with OCD. Analyze clinical profiles, including age at diagnosis, duration of symptoms etc. Investigate treatment patterns and medication usage. Assess symptom severity using Y-BOCS scores for obsessions and compulsions. Explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.

## Tools Used:

MySQL Workbench: Utilized for data exploration, manipulation, and querying.

Power BI: Employed for visualization of insights derived from the MySQL data.

## Steps:
- Data Exploration
- Querying
- Data Visualization

## Conclusion:
The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the OCD healthcare dataset through exploratory data analysis. By leveraging MySQL Workbench for data exploration and Power BI for visualization, the analysis seeks to uncover valuable insights that can inform clinical practice, research, and decision-making in OCD healthcare management.
